title: "Efficient Access History for Race Detection"
collection: publications
permalink:
excerpt: 'Race detection typically consists of two components, reachability analysis and access history. Most of the research
has focused on the former while little attention has been paid to access history, which stores all memory locations previous instructions have
accessed. In theory, the access history component adds no asymptotic overhead, but in practice, it is often the most expensive component. 
We leverage the temporal and spatial locality of parallel programs and combine contiguous memory accesses into intervals. 
We propose coalescing strategies, both in compiler-time and runtime, and a tree-based access history data structure to fully reap the benefit
of maintaining access history at the granularity of intervals.'
